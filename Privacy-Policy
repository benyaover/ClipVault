Privacy Policy for ClipVault

Effective Date: 04/01/2025

1. Introduction
ClipVault (“we,” “us,” or “our”) is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how our iOS app, ClipVault, collects, uses, and safeguards the information you provide when you use the app.

2. Information Collection and Use
	•	Local Data Storage:
ClipVault is designed solely to manage and display your clipboard history. All data processed by the app is stored locally on your device. We do not collect, transmit, or store any personal data on external servers.
	•	No Third-Party Sharing:
We do not sell, share, or disclose your clipboard data to any third parties. Your data remains on your device unless you choose to delete it using the in-app “Erase” function.

3. Data Security
	•	The app employs reasonable security measures to protect your data stored locally on your device.
	•	As no data is transmitted externally, the risk of unauthorized access during transmission is minimized.

4. Data Retention
	•	Clipboard data is retained locally for as long as you use ClipVault or until you manually erase it.
	•	Deleting your clipboard history or uninstalling the app will remove the data permanently from your device.

5. Third-Party Services
	•	At this time, ClipVault does not integrate any third-party services that collect or process personal data.
	•	Should we add such integrations in the future (e.g., for analytics or advertising), we will update this Privacy Policy accordingly and ensure that those services comply with applicable privacy laws.

6. User Rights
	•	Control Over Data:
You have complete control over the clipboard data stored on your device. You can view, modify, or delete this data at any time using the app’s features.
	•	Questions or Concerns:
If you have any questions or concerns about our data practices or this Privacy Policy, please contact us at [Your Contact Email].

7. Children’s Privacy
	•	ClipVault is not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe that we have inadvertently collected data from a child under 13, please contact us immediately so that we can take appropriate steps to remove the information.

8. Changes to This Privacy Policy
	•	We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. The updated version will be posted within the app and on our website (if applicable) with a revised effective date.
	•	We encourage you to review this policy periodically for any changes.
